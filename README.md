# Reinforcement Learning Experiments

For each of the following experiments, I use Stable Baselines 3 to find optimal policies via different algorithms. This repository contains the following RL experiments:

1. Lunar Lander: [Link](https://github.com/aritrakar/rl-exp/blob/main/lunar_lander.py)
2. Snake game: [Link](https://github.com/aritrakar/rl-exp/tree/main/Snake)
